## What is Kaboom?
The best way to explain what Kaboom is meant to be is the 'Trakt of comics and cartoons' - a comic tracker/database. Currently its just a skeleton, the only way to interface with the database is through the Django API - there is a limited frontend. Hopefully in the future there will be multiple different clients built off of the API, abit like Trakt. The database includes metadata for comics and cartoons, as well as some user accounts functionality.
